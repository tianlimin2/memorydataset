User: I've been more active lately; should I monitor my blood pressure after exercise? Assistant: Given your symptom control, extending the interval for your immunological tests sounds reasonable. We'll schedule them less frequently but remain vigilant for any new symptoms. User: Since my symptoms are under control, can we extend the interval for my immunological tests? Assistant: Dietary changes usually begin to reflect in electrolyte levels within a few weeks. We'll conduct tests then to assess the impact of your new diet. User: I've adjusted my diet; how soon can we expect to see improvements in my electrolyte levels?
