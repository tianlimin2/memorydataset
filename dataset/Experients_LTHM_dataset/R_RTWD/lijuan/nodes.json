It is advisable to consult a doctor as soon as possible for further examination and to develop an appropriate management plan. User: Recently my fasting blood sugar is around 7.5 mmol/L, and sometimes my blood sugar two hours after meals goes up to 12.5 mmol/L. Is this normal? Assistant: Thirst and increased urination can be symptoms of high blood sugar, but they could also be caused by other factors. It is recommended to check your blood sugar levels soon and consult a doctor to determine the cause. User: I've been feeling a bit thirsty frequently lately, and my urination has increased. Could this be a sign of high blood sugar? Assistant: Reducing sugary foods and rice can help manage blood sugar, but high-calorie foods should also be strictly controlled. It is advisable to choose low-GI (glycemic index) foods and limit high-calorie food intake to better manage blood sugar. User: I’ve been trying to reduce my intake of sugary foods and rice, but sometimes I can’t resist eating high-calorie foods. Assistant: Walking for half an hour every day is a good start and can help control blood sugar. You can gradually increase the amount of exercise or add some higher-intensity activities, such as brisk walking or light aerobic exercises, to further promote health. User: I’ve been walking for half an hour every day. Is this amount of exercise sufficient? Assistant: Weight loss may be related to blood sugar control, but there could be other causes as well. Monitor your weight changes closely and consult a doctor to rule out potential health issues. User: I’ve noticed a slight weight loss recently and am unsure if it's related to my blood sugar."
