However, the user later reported a decrease in morning blood pressure spikes, although they were unsure if the pressure was fully under control. There were also instances of occasional dizziness which could be due to blood pressure dropping too low. Despite these improvements, careful monitoring of blood pressure readings was recommended due to the user's heart conditions.",

However, the user has reported occasional dizziness, which could be due to blood pressure dropping too low. Consistent high blood pressure readings in the morning were also mentioned, which could potentially cause symptoms like fatigue or palpitations. These symptoms can be indicators of fluctuating or abnormal blood pressure. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and discussing these symptoms with a healthcare provider is recommended.",

They've experienced a plateau in their weight loss, which could be influenced by high LDL-C levels, fluctuating blood pressure, potential medication side effects, and their exercise routine. Despite the slow progress, the user's health has improved in some areas, such as controlled cholesterol levels and decreased blood pressure spikes. Regular adjustments to their diet, exercise, and medication are recommended to help improve their weight loss progress.",
