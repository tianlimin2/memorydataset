To help control your blood pressure, I suggest reducing your intake of salt and fats, and trying to get at least 30 minutes of light exercise daily. Do you think this change is doable?

User: I sometimes forget to take my medication, so it's not very consistent. Assistant: Taking your medication regularly is very important, Chen Fang. Maybe setting a daily reminder could help you remember to take it on time. How does that sound? User: That's a good idea, I'll set a reminder. Assistant: Great! Also, monitoring your blood pressure is important. Do you have a habit of checking your blood pressure at home? User: No, I don't really focus on monitoring it."
