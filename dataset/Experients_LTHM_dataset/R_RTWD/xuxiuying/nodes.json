It's important to manage these levels through diet or medication. User: Should I be concerned about high uric acid levels even if I don't have uric acid stones? Assistant: Measuring citrate intake isn't typically done at home; however, consuming foods known to be high in citrate, like citrus fruits, can ensure adequate intake. User: Is there an effective way to measure daily citrate intake? Assistant: If using diuretics for stone prevention, it's crucial to balance them with adequate hydration to avoid dehydration, which can itself cause stones. User: What are the best practices for using diuretics to prevent stone formation? Assistant: Routine blood work is typically recommended annually, or more frequently if you have ongoing health issues or are making significant changes to your medication or diet. User: How often should I get blood work done to check for metabolic issues?"
