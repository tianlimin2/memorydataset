Try gentle stretching exercises daily, such as yoga and light gymnastics, to improve flexibility. Let's review this again after a few days. User: I've been noticing some stiffness when I try to bend sideways. How should I track this? Assistant: An increase in CRP can indicate inflammation. I'll suggest adjusting your current NSAIDs dosage or exploring biologics if needed. Regularly monitoring these markers will help us understand how your condition is evolving. User: My latest blood test showed a slight increase in CRP. Is that a concern? Assistant: Regular imaging, including X-rays or MRIs, is essential to track any changes in your spine and joints. If recent images show progression or new inflammation, we might need to adjust your treatment plan. User: Do I need to schedule another MRI soon? Assistant: Extended morning stiffness can impact your daily routine. I'll adjust your pain management plan, which may include specific medications, physical therapy, and relaxation techniques to help ease the discomfort. User: Morning stiffness seems to last longer than before. What can I do? Assistant: A higher BASFI score indicates more difficulty in daily activities.

User: I’m noticing some progress with my flexibility. Should I increase my exercise intensity? Assistant: This is a positive trend. We’ll continue with the current treatment and monitor your inflammation markers to ensure they remain low. User: CRP and ESR levels are both slightly lower. What’s next? Assistant: Yes, regular imaging is crucial for early detection of any changes, even if everything seems stable. We’ll keep the frequency at a manageable level. User: Should I still plan for regular imaging even if things seem stable? Assistant: Try taking short breaks to stand and stretch every hour. This can help prevent stiffness after sitting for long periods. User: Pain is manageable during the day, but I get stiff after sitting for a while.
