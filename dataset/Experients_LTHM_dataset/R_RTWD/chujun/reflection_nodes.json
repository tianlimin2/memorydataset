The assistant emphasized the importance of avoiding environmental triggers, such as viral infections, certain medications, and toxins. Key monitoring indicators for liver function were identified as ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin levels, which should be checked every 2-3 months. The normal ranges for these indicators are typically below 40 IU/L for ALT and AST, below 120 IU/L for ALP, and below 1.2 mg/dL for total bilirubin. However, specific targets should be provided by the doctor based on the patient's situation.\n\nSymptoms to watch for include increased fatigue, jaundice (yellowing of skin/eyes), abdominal pain, and changes in appetite, which could indicate worsening liver health. Regular blood tests were stressed as crucial for monitoring liver health.
